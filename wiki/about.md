## Lab Activities

Our research seeks to elucidate the neural underpinnings of emotion. Our progress ultimately relies upon a symbiosis of Psychological theory and Neuroscience methods.



## Lab Goals

- To characterize the anatomical trajectories of affective circuits in the brain.
- To characterize how psychopharmacological (drug) manipulations modulate affective experience.
- To understand how the function of these affective circuits is damaged in affective disorders and addiction.
- To understand how psycho- and pharmaco- therapies can normalize damaged affective circuits.
- To understand how affective circuitry modulates decision-making and economic behavior
- To innovate and create new technologies and techniques for tracking affective dynamics in the brain.

Our current focus has been on how affective circuits (affective neuroscience) influence mental health symptoms (neurophenomics) and choice (neuroeconomics). Our proactive view of affect differs from the traditional view of emotion, which emphasizes its' reactive nature.
Thus, the phrase "anticipatory affect" refers to valenced and aroused emotions that occur when people are anticipating an uncertain outcome. We believe anticipatory affective states (i.e., positive and negative arousal) are best situated to influence upcoming behavior.



## Research Process

Our research tends to follow this trajectory (the "diamond pipeline"):

BRAINSTORM IDEAS → SUBMIT PROPOSALS → BEHAVIORAL PILOTS → BEHAVIORAL STUDY → FMRI STUDY → DATA PROCESSING → DATA ANALYSIS → PUBLICATION → FAME AND FORTUNE (hopefully)

Typical time through the pipeline is 2-3 years (estimates for each step to be added, as well as ideas for shortening).

## How do I get started?

#### Undergraduates
- Take some serious time over the course of a week or two to read Scott Huettel’s Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging textbook. Aside from some unavoidably gnarly physics, it’s well-written and accessible to readers, even those with very little background in psychology or biology. Don’t worry about retaining everything; a good once-through will make what we do here in the lab a lot more understandable.
- Read through this manual.
- Spend some quality time with the lab’s Unix/Linux books. This will save you time later on.
- Familiarize yourself with the lab’s publications. They’re available on the lab homepage (www-psych.stanford.edu/~span/).
- Talk to the lab coordinator to see if there’s anything else you need to do.

#### Graduate Students
- Figure out what your SUId name and SUId number are.
- Check to see if your Stanford email account is working; you can do this at webmail.stanford.edu.
- Go to the ID office to get an ID card.
- Talk to Harry Bahlman, the building facilities manager/guru, about obtaining a key to your office and swipe card access to the building.  Harry is located on the LL (lower level) in room 01-420. You can also email him at harry@psych.stanford.edu.
- Bring computer to Peter to get it set up for wireless. Also for a psych email address.
- Contact Anne Sawyer to sign up for a scanner safety training course (amsawyer@stanford.edu); it’s required before you can enter the magnet room and it’s only held once or twice a month.
- To run human subjects, you need to complete the university’s human subjects use course, which is run by CITI.
- You’ll also want to read about the rules and regulations particular to Stanford in the Research Policy Handbook (http://www.stanford.edu/dept/DoR/rph/Chpt7.html/), and on the Stanford Human Subjects Research page (http://humansubjects.stanford.edu/)
- Make sure you’re comfortable with EPrime (a popular psychology experiment package that allows you to create experiment modules on the computer -- we use this for the stimuli subjects see while in the scanner) and the Linux environment.
- If you’re not already an fMRI guru, take some serious time over the course of a week or two to read Scott Huettel’s Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging textbook. Aside from some unavoidably gnarly physics, it’s well-written and accessible to most readers, even those with very little background in psychology or biology. Don’t worry about retaining everything; a good once-through will make what we do here in the lab a lot more understandable.

#### RAs
- Contact Anne Sawyer (amsawyer@stanford.edu) to sign up for the next available scanner safety course. Be sure to tell her your name, your lab association, and that you will be in the lab for more than six months. The Lucas Center does not train people who will not be using the magnet for more than half a year. You cannot enter the magnet room without this training.
- If you’re not already an fMRI guru, take some serious time over the course of a week or two to read Scott Huettel’s Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging textbook. Aside from some unavoidably gnarly physics, it’s well-written and accessible to most readers, even those with very little background in psychology or biology. Don’t worry about retaining everything; a good once-through will make what we do here in the lab a lot more understandable.
- Talk to HR to make sure all your paperwork is in order. Bring a cancelled check to sign up for direct deposit. Also bring your passport and contact information for your emergency contact sheet (phone numbers and addresses).
- Make an appointment with the department HR contact to go over Kronos (this is currently Bhavna Raval, braval@stanford.edu)
- Figure out what your SUId name and SUId number are.
- Check to see if your Stanford email account is working; you can do this at webmail.stanford.edu.
- Go to the ID office to get an ID card. [insert map]
- Talk to Harry Bahlman, the building facilities manager/guru, about obtaining a key to your office and swipe card access to the building. Harry is located on the LL (lower level) in room 01-420. You can also email him at harry@psych.stanford.edu.
- If you’re an RA, log on to axess.stanford.edu to enroll in the Stanford 101 course (Training tab → Search Catalog → “Stanford 101”). It’s required of all employees, and it’s where you receive all your benefits information. Be sure to do this within 30 days of your first day on the job – if you don’t, you’ll be automatically enrolled in default benefits plans, will miss others, and won’t be able to change anything till the next “open enrollment,” which only occurs once a year.
- To run human subjects, you need to complete the university’s human subjects use course, which is run by CITI.
- You’ll also want to read about the rules and regulations particular to Stanford in the Research Policy Handbook (http://www.stanford.edu/dept/DoR/rph/Chpt7.html/), and on the Stanford Human Subjects Research page (http://humansubjects.stanford.edu/)

## What's where?

SPAN lab is small in physical size and big on ideas. The lab space can be broken into four areas: room 465 (the main SPAN lab room), room 467 (the SPAN experiment room), the Lucas Center (this is where we scan, it’s located at the Med School), and grad student offices.

__Room 465: The main lab room:__ This room houses the printer, the MacBook (this computer is called ‘insula’), a Linux workstation (‘dmthal’), an old iBook, the file cabinets, and some reference materials on the bookshelf.

__Lab Manager:__ Use this resource sparingly to answer any question. Bother him/her more than and/or prior to bothering Rm 470 (Prof. Knutson).

__Spanlab Printer:__ You can print here from any of the Mac or Linux computers. The name of the printer is spanlab (ip address spanlab.Stanford.edu). That should automatically come up on a Mac, but for Windows configuration, you may need to dig up the printer CD and find just the right folder for the drivers (this may be trial-and-error, sorry).

__MacBook (‘insula’ –knutson@insula.stanford.edu):__ Insula is the main station in the lab for using Photoshop CS3, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Deltagraph, and SPSS. It also works as a terminal to connect to the Linux stations remotely (use the X11 utility and type “ssh –Y span@dmthal.stanford.edu” in the terminal window to connect to dmthal; importantly use “-Y” on this computer). To find data for a study (e.g. activation timecourse spreadsheets) click on the “Macintosh HD” icon on the desktop and go to the folder /Users/Knutson/data. There is a folder for every study where you will find spreadsheets of data and whatnot. Note that all logins will be span@insertcomputername except for insula, which is Knutson@.

__dmthal:__ A fast Linux workstation (from summer 2005). This computer replaced mpfc as the primary computer for data processing and storage. It contains a dual-core processor and 500GB+ of storage. New studies will go on this computer (until it is retired).

#### Filing cabinet:
- 1st drawer – pens, pins, other supplies.
- 2nd drawer – copies of consent forms and payment sheets.
- 3rd drawer – subject folders (one folder for every subject scanned, containing questionnaires and consent).
- 4th drawer – file folders.
