#What Does the Lab Do?

Our research seeks to elucidate the neural underpinnings of emotion. Our progress ultimately relies upon a symbiosis of psychological theory and neuroscience methods.

# Lab Goals

* To characterize the anatomical trajectories of affective circuits in the brain.
* To characterize how psychopharmacological (drug) manipulations modulate affective experience.
* To understand how the function of these affective circuits is damaged in affective disorders and addiction.
* To understand how psycho- and pharmaco- therapies can normalize damaged affective circuits.
* To understand, by reducing the problem to its individual components, how affect
ive circuitry modulates decision-making and economic behavior
* To innovate and create new technologies and techniques for tracking affective dynamics in the brain.

Basically, our current focus is on how emotion influences decisions (including financial) and mental health symptoms. 
This proactive view differs from the traditional view of emotion, which emphasizes emotion's reactive nature. 
The phrase "anticipatory affect" refers to valenced and aroused emotions that occur when people are anticipating an uncertain outcome. 
We think these these states are best situated to influence what we do next.

# Overview of Research Process

Generally speaking, research in the lab follows this trajectory (a.k.a., the "pipeline"):

BRAINSTORM → IRB PROPOSAL → PILOT → TWEAK → BEHAVIORAL STUDY → FMRI STUDY → PROCESSING → ANALYSIS → PUBLICATION → FAME AND FORTUNE

Each of these steps appears later in greater detail, but first, an overview of key regions and their functions.
