**Instructions for getting access to the Small Animal Imaging Facility:**

Pick up a packet at the Clark Center front desk, which will give step-by-step instructions about how to get access to the facility.  Contact Laura Pisani (lpisani@stanford.edu) with any questions.  

There are several trainings you will have to complete, which can be access through your Stanford Axess page, under "STARS": 

1. General Safety

2. Animal Care and Use Program

3. Biosafety

4. Computer Workstation Ergonomics

5. Compressed Gas Safety

6. Laboratory Animal Care & Use

7. Working Safely Near Radioactive Materials

8. Chemical Safety for Laboratories

Depending on the type of experiments you will be conducting, you may also have to do an in-person training (VSC-0022B),
which you can register for online as for the online trainings.

After completing all necessary trainings and getting a PI's signature, drop off paperwork at the Clark Center front desk (typically the paperwork gets processed in 24 hours and you'll be granted access to the facility)
