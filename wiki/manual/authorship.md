Determining Authorship: 

Authorship can take one of three common formats: 
(1) Largest contribution first (e.g., Psychology); 
(2) Lead author first, senior author last (e.g., Medicine); 
(3) Alphabetical (e.g., Economics). 
We use a mix of (1) and (2; essentially, for the senior author). Historically, the lead author 
typically has expended over 70% of the effort to get the paper from the idea to publication phase 
(as well as subsequent promotion).

Because publishing articles takes a long time (hopefully 2-3 years, see the Pipeline section), 
contributions are more commonly determined at the end than at the beginning of a project, 
although it is essential to determine lead authorship at the outset (which may nevertheless change if people leave).

While determining contributions can present some ambiguity, recent journal guidelines which require stated contributions 
have made the task more straightforward. Consider as an example the contributions section of a recently published paper from our lab: 
"Author contributions: A.G., C.Y., and B.K. designed research; A.G. performed research; A.G. and B.K. analyzed data; 
A.G., C.Y., and B.K. wrote the paper."

Based on the logic of formats (1) and (2), A.G. is the lead author (first = greatest contribution), and B.K. the senior author (last). 
Other authors fall in between in order of contribution (in rare cases in which there are more than one lead authors who have contributed 
equally, this can be denoted with an asterisk and a footnote).
