# Interviewing Potential RAs

# Overview

Interviewing can be stressful for both interviewer and the interviewee.  The point of the interview is the adequately assess a candidate's match and potential contribution to the lab.  SPANLAB often receives requests from current students and graduates who are interested in joining the team, but takes relatively few on.  Before any final decision is made, it's important to sit down with the potential RA and establish that their commitment, experience, and personality is right for the job. Ultimately, we aim for mutual benefit (they move work towards publication, while we move them towards the next career goal) -- judging by alumni career trajectories (see http://stanford.edu/group/spanlab/People/people.html), this is an attainable goal!

# Possible Questions
* How did you find out about the lab?
* Have you read any of our recent publications?  If so, what were your impressions? How might you improve or build on the research?
* Have you seen our web site? Are there any projects in particular that you would be most interested in working on?
* Do you have any previous research experience? Who was your supervisor? What were your specific duties?
* What other relevant skills do you have? (e.g., coding? statistical analysis? neuroanatomy? scanning?)
* Can you give us an idea of your current time commitments? How many hours per week do you want to work in the lab?

# Relevant Details
* Time commitment:
  * We usually look for 1-2 years of commitment on a regular schedule.
  * The psychology department, UAL, and several other university programs can often provide funding for summer research.
  * During the school year, students can sign up for credit (through Psych 171 or Psych 195) or work study.
* Helpful attributes:
 * Persistence
   * Can you overcome failure to persist and eventually make incremental progress? 
 * Initiative
   * Do you research first, then ask? Can you organize and implement a plan for action?
 * Openness
   * Are you interested in learning new concepts and methods and bridging different areas of study?
 * Organization
   * Do you typically document what you've done and keep a regular log? Have you written up any projects for publication?
 * Independence
   * Are you able to take responsibility for and make independent progress on a problem? 
 * Creativity
   * Can you tolerate uncertainty and make headway on scientific questions that not many have previously investigated? Can you build tools that help you and others to make progress in unknown territory?
