If you "bump" an unfunded user from the scanner schedule and then decide to cancel the
scan time, please send the following people an email so we can return it to the unfunded
bumped user:

tnewton@stanford.edu
dcronister@stanford.edu
amsawyer@stanford.edu

This would be especially useful for those that bump 24 hours before the scan time and then
cancel the scheduled scan time a short time later.

Thanks, Anne
