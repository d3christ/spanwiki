## Quick Reference
Here are some useful downloads:
  - Download [a set of examples with e-prime files]() (Best way to get started)
  - Download [txt2matrix.py]()
    - You will have to edit the section at the top of this script
  - Download [example text replace script]()
    - this is useful for changing word codes to number codes
  - Download [makeVec.py]()
    - Do not edit this script
  - Download [example vector description file]()
    - You will need to rewrite this to fit your study
    
It is convenient to run these scripts from your regression script. For an example of this see the [GLM](glm.md) section.
