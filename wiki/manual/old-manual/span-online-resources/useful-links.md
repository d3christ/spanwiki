http://mindhive.mit.edu/imaging - This book is a wholesale port of the original Stanford Gablab Wiki. It is in the process of being ported from a static HTML dump of the site, and as such contains non-functional Wiki links and references to documents that existed on the old site. Bugs will be fixed and content updated after the original content has been transplanted here.
