## When
Clearances need to be done before 6 months after receiving an advance for human subjects payments.
For the general lab grants, Erlinda will send the lab manager an e-mail about a week before the advances are due.

## How (for the general lab)
  1. First find out from Erlinda how much the original advance was for and which grant the advance came from.
  2. Go through the payment binder, identify the studies that should be covered by the given grant, and then collect enough payment receipts from these studies to add up to the advance amount.
  3. Always check and double check to make sure that every receipt has a SSN on the top. If it does not, you can not turn it in with the advance. You will have to try to look it up on the consent form or re-contact the subject to try to get the number.
  4. Make copies of all of the forms to keep in the lab.
  5. Turn in all the original forms to Erlinda. If the forms do not add up exactly to the amount, you will also need to write a check (often a very small check) from the spanlab account to cover the remaining funds.

## How (for bipo-rewards study only)
### Organize Human Subjects Payment Receipts
  1. Cut up (if necessary) and alphabetize your human subjects receipts and tape them to blank pages in alphabetical order by last name.
  2. Write a sub total at the bottom of each page.
  3. Write a grand total at the top of the first page in the upper left, as well as pertinent study identification information: e.g.
  ```
BIPOLAR REWARDS STUDY CLEARANCE 07-02-08 JENNY PEGG TOTAL ALTOGETHER: $645.70
  ```
  4. Photocopy and file away.

### Create an Excel Spreadsheet Record
__Important:__ Be careful to use the exact format prescribed in previous spreadsheets.

  1. Use all CAPS (no lowercase)
  2. Alphabetize by last name
  3. Only include people who were paid more than $100 in this clearance round.
  4. You may not need to fill in the tax country code or province if not applicable.
  5. Save in the 'text (windows)' format and 'xls' format.

### Turn In
  1. Email spreadsheet to your relevant account person. Include both the .xls and the .txt files.
  2. Turn in payment forms
  3. Write a check for any unpaid money to Stanford University and give to your account manager
