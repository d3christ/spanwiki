<a name="getting-subjects"></a>
## Where to get subjects
  - Qualtrics (survey)
  - Sona (department-behavior, potential issue with belief)
  - Mailing lists: The lab will be making 'gold' and 'gray' lists for good, reusable subjects and one's who aren't...
  - We can use professional samplers to find subjects of a certain demographic at $100 / per head.

_Note: handouts ineffective unless handed out._

<a name="running-subjects"></a>
## How to run subjects
Train subjects with a small version of the task

Then scan (with instructions / ratings)

Behavioral assessments

_Note: get .doc script example from Alex -- he was able to run 10 subjects in a day by letting scanning and pre/post-prep overlap between subjects._

<a name="logging-subjects"></a>
## How to log subjects
Get brain (cni) and behavior (Google Drive) in same directory

Naming conventions: study IV and DV (e.g., `fmrifund`), subject initials and data (e.g., `ms150930`)

Subject logs can be kept remotely, but eventually print and put in brown book
