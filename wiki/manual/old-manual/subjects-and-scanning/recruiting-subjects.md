Where to get Subjects[edit]
Qualtrics (survey)

Sona (department-behavior, potential issue with belief)

Mailing lists: The lab will be making 'gold' and 'gray' lists for good, reusable subjects and one's who aren't...

We can use professional samplers to find subjects of a certain demographic at $100 / per head.

notes: handouts ineffective unless handed out

Screening Subjects[edit]
mri and lab by phone

consent and training in the lab

How to run subjects[edit]
Train subjects with a small version of the task.

Then scan (with instructions / ratings)

Behavioral assessments

note: get .doc script example from alex -- he was able to run 10 subjects in a day by letting scanning and pre/post-prep overlap between subjects.

How to log subjects[edit]
get brain (cni) and behavior (google drive) in same directory

naming conventions: study iv and dv (e.g., fmrifund), subject initials and data (e.g., ms150930)

Subject logs can be kept remotely, but eventually print and put in brown book
