## Where to get Subjects
  - Qualtrics (survey)
  - Sona (department-behavior, potential issue with belief)
  - Mailing lists: The lab will be making 'gold' and 'gray' lists for good, reusable subjects and one's who aren't...
  - We can use professional samplers to find subjects of a certain demographic at $100 / per head.\
\
_Note: handouts ineffective unless handed out._

## Screening Subjects
MRI and lab by phone\
Consent and training in the lab

## How to run subjects
Train subjects with a small version of the task\
Then scan (with instructions / ratings)\
Behavioral assessments

_Note: get .doc script example from alex -- he was able to run 10 subjects in a day by letting scanning and pre/post-prep overlap between subjects._

## How to log subjects
Get brain (cni) and behavior (google drive) in same directory\
Naming conventions: study iv and dv (e.g., `fmrifund`), subject initials and data (e.g., `ms150930`)\
Subject logs can be kept remotely, but eventually print and put in brown book
