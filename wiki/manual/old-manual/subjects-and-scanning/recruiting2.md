## Sona
If you are recruiting young healthy subjects you should use Sona. It is an online site administered by Stanford that has
a large subject pool and many convenient features for scheduling.

__Website:__ stanfordpsychpaid.sona-systems.com

__How to Get an Account:__ Contact the human subjects (HS) coordinator at hscoordinator@lists.stanford.edu (currently (2009) this is Amanda Foster). You must be up to date with your CITI training and She will need a copy of the IRB approval letter for your study. You can get this from the Lab Coordinator.

__Note:__ When you set up your study be sure to make sure to check __"Are you a U.S. Citizen?"__ in the Prescreening Requirements and set the answer to __yes!__

## Q-Day
Q-Day is the survey day for Psych 1. If you need a short survey filled out fast for free, this is the way to go. If you want to do this be sure to check with the HS coordinator at hscoordinator@lists.stanford.edu or the Lab Coordinator well in advance to find out about impending __deadlines__ and to get an __Application__.

## Bay Area Research
If you are trying to recruit an unusual population (i.e. a clinical population, an aging population or a particular demographic) you could consider using the Bay Area Research group. This is a recruitment agency that will manage all the details of recruiting and scheduling your subjects but for a hefty fee. You'll have to discuss this option with Brian who can give you more details on how to contact the agency.
