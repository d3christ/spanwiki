## Scheduling Subjects
For recruiting see the [recruiting](recruiting2.md) section of the manual. If you are using sona, there is an option to recruit only participants that do not have metal implants (however, you still need to go over the screening forms).

Before contacting a potential participant, check the SPAN Lab Gray List, which documents potentially problematic participants. You can access this list by logging into Google Docs and viewing the SPAN Lab Scanning Participant Gray List:

- Go to http://www.google.com/documents
  - __Name:__ "spanlab"
  - __Password:__ balnaps
  - When done, logout

Make sure to screen all of your subjects before the scan using the magnet screening form and the span lab screening form.

You must also have your subject check the magnet screening form at the scanner the day of the scan, even though you already went over the form on the phone.

Add the event to the lab calendar:

## Scanning
Before leaving for the Lucas Center you’ll need:
  - The right study questionnaires
  - Participants’ screening forms
  - Consent form (2 copies)
  - Brian’s log book
  - Human subjects payment sheet
  - Cash
  - Subject phone #’s (just in case)
  - Your card key
  
### Meet your subject
  - If scanning before 5 pm, meet your subject out on Welch Road and provide him or her with a parking pass (located in folder near window between the restroom area and the scanner computer room). The pass is good for spaces in the Oak Road Parking Lot, located across Welch from the Lucas Center and accessible from Pasteur Drive.
  - Check that the magnet screen is okay
  - Review the consent form with your subject
  - Get him or her a locker, have your subject remove all metallic objects from his or her person – also make sure wallets don’t go into the magnet room (the magnet will demagnetize credit cards)
  - Check to see if the subject needs to be fitted with scanner-safe reading glasses. These are located in a black case above the eprime computer.
  
### Set up in magnet room
  - Head coil, mirror, bite bar set up, pad, sheets, earplugs
  - Turn on projector
  
### Refer to task-specific training document for training script
  - Emphasize understanding of the task, stimuli; have the subject do a practice run if appropriate.
  
### Bite bar fitting
  - Explain concerns about head motion – “When inside the scanner, please remember that it is important to keep your head motionless. To make this possible we will make a bite bar with an impression of your teeth.” It helps to show them with a ruler or your fingers just how little movement can be corrected by the software – people don’t realize what ‘try not to move’ really entails and are probably thinking on the scale of a half inch rather than a millimeter or two.
  - Explain the position that they will be in when inside the scanner (with head tilted back slightly)
  - Take an impression of his or her teeth. Hold the bite bar yourself and make sure it is straight and that the participant’s head is tilted slightly back when they bite down.
  - To make a bite bar, take a half-teaspoon of the grey putty and a half-teaspoon of the red putty, kneed with your fingers until a uniform color, and fit over the bite bar form. The putty and bite bar structure is located in the drawer labeled “Knutson” over by the medical prep bed area and sink.
  
###   General set-up
  - Enter info into Lucas logbook (located to the left of the magnet computer on top of some audio equipment).
  - Have your subject fill out a consent form, task-specific pre-scan questionnaires, and a pre-scan screening form if it has not been completed already. Give the subject an extra copy of the consent form to take home.
  - Enter info into Brian’s logbook (name, gender, ethnicity, subject number, task, exam # [located on top RH side of the magnet computer screen after the scan begins], a space for I & S values, and winnings after they have completed the task, as well as general notes on the scan).
  
### Prepare Signa (GE Operation Program) on the Scanner Computer
You’ll need to set up the patient profile (in the RX manager on the scanner computer) before the landmark is made.
  - Click the picture of the scanner, then “NewPt”
  - Complete the following fields using info from the screening form:
      - __Patient ID:__ B Knutson	\<enter>
      - __Operator:__ Your initials
      - __Normal Mode__
      - __Patient name:__ \[First Last] \<enter>
      - __Weight (lbs):__ \[xxx]	\<enter>
      - __Exam description (head and participant’s DOB):__ \[head DOB mm/dd/yyyy] \<enter>
  - Click the head graphic
  - In the list of protocols, select your protocol
  - If it’s not there, click “Site” and try again
  
### Getting the participant set up in the scanner
  - Double check for metallic objects. NO metal can enter the scanning room (including bobby pins, small clips, coins, underwire bras, etc). Most jeans are okay provided they don’t have unusual metallic decoration. Belts are not okay, even if the subject claims no metal in the belt. Refer to your scanner training materials for comprehensive safety information.
  - Remind the participant to use the restroom.
  - Have the participant put in earplugs (remember to speak loudly and clearly from here on out).
  - Have the participant lie down on the scanner table, and ask him or her to move up so that his or her shoulders are flush with the head cradle posts. Place a pillow underneath his or her legs, place small pads between the subject’s shoulders and the head cradle so that it doesn’t dig in and make them uncomfortable, and ask if he/she wants a blanket.
  - Hand the participant the button box, tape the squeeze ball to his or her shirt using the tape located next to the projector, and explain both. The squeeze ball is there in case of emergency or if they just want to get out – they can squeeze it, which will set off an alarm in the scan room. The alarm box is next to the scanner computer; press reset to turn it off.
  - Explain the sequence of scans (pre-task localizers, # of sessions of task, post-task structural). Ask if the subject needs you to review the task itself.
  - Position the bite bar.
  - Make sure the participant is completely comfortable and make adjustments as needed. Do not continue with the scan unless the bite bar setup is straight, the participant is comfortable, and the head coil slides into place without trouble.
  - Align participant (press ‘align on,’ move scanner bed inward until crosshairs are right above eyebrows, press ‘landmark’)
  - Slide head coil into place and then check that the participant can see the mirror.
  - Tell the participant that you will communicate over the intercom and then move participant into place.
  - Check to make sure the task screens are centered once the subject is all the way in. The easiest way to do this is by creating a test screen with a representative slide from your task. Ask the subject whether they can see the top and bottom, and check to make sure it’s in focus and centered. Make adjustments as necessary.
  - Now you’re ready to go! Head back to the scanner computer.
  
### Collecting Physio Data
_Note:_ If you are going to use the physiology equipment you should probably contact Anne Sawyer to get an overview of how to treat the equipment.

#### The bellows belt:
  - This is the black rubber tube with a section in the middle that looks like an accordion. This belt is used to collect respiration data.
  - The subject should wear the belt around their abdominal at the place that expands the most as they breath. This will depend on the subject but it will either be the belly or the chest.
  - Fasten the belt with the Velcro on the ends of the belt. You should fit the belt with some tension on the bellows but not so much that it will not expand when the subject breaths.
 
#### The pulse monitor:
  - This is the white clasp that goes over the subjects finger to monitor the subjects pulse.
  - The subject should wear the clasp on the index finger.
  - __Important Note:__ The subject will not be able to use the button box with the had that the monitor is on for two very good reasons: 
    1. The wires of the pulse monitor need to be kept away from the wires of the button box.
    2. If the subject moves his/her hand in response to the task, this will corrupt the pulse signal and render it meaningless.
    
#### Computer settings:
  - On the user CVs page of your scan protocol:
      1. Set the xfer CV on that page to 45 if not already using 31.
      2. Set the physio monitoring option to on
  - Doing this will generate a file called Pfile.physio after the scan concludes. That file has cardiac trigger info, expressed as sample numbers at which a trigger occurred (40 Hz sampling rate), followed by -9999, followed by respiratory data sampled at 40 Hz. There is a script that will read this data on Gary's website in fmriutil, called readphys12.m.
  
### Scan Procedure
  - Make sure scanner is in research mode
  - Click on “scan modes”
  - Make sure “Research” is selected (NOT clinical! If the scanner is in clinical mode, it will not run spiral in-out research sequences.)
  
#### Scan #1 – 3 plane localizer (~40sec)[edit]
  - Ask subject if he can hear you, and adjust volume with knobs on top of keyboard
    - ear → what we hear
    - mouth → what participant hears
  - Press the bar at the top of the keyboard to turn the intercom on so that the subject can hear what you say. Keep in mind it’s like a walky-talky – you won’t be able to hear them while it’s pressed, and they can’t hear you if it’s not pressed. Tell subject:
      ```
      “OK, we’re going to do three very short structural scans that are each under a minute.
      Please remember not to move your head during or in between scans.
      You’re going to hear some clicks in just a minute.”
      ```
  - Turn the lights down
  - Select: “3 plane local”, then “view edit” (alternatively, just click “3 plane local” twice)
  - Press: “Save series”
  - Press: “Download”
  - Press: “Scan”
  - Write down exam number in the lab scanner notebook – to find the number, look at the scan window in the upper right corner (e.g, Exam # 4527).
