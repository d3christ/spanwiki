<b>Goals/Motivation:</b>

Benefits of presenting a poster include

1. Publicizing your research to the scientific community
2. Learning about other people's research and exchanging ideas
3. Networking with potential employers and hearing about job opportunities
4. Reconnecting with friends and former colleagues
5. Being able to list the poster presentation on your CV

<b>Design:</b> 

1. Make your poster as easy to read as possible by minimizing the amount of text
2. Consider indicating what part of a figure the viewer should be focusing on (like marking an ROI with a red circle)
3. Be specific with your results (an example would be to write "x increases y," rather than "x is related to y")
4. Include the poster number and/or session number at the top to make it easier for people to find it during the presentation

<b>Submission:</b>

1. If you submit a poster, make sure you will be around to present it!
2. Underpromise, overdeliver
3. Aim for publication
