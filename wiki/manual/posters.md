# <b>Poster Presentations</b>: 

Here are two poster <i>templates</i> you can download and modify (both have standard dimensions of 48" x 36"). 
There is a poster printer in the 5th floor printer room that is free to use.

<b>Goals/Motivation:</b>

1. Publicizing your research to the scientific community and getting feedback
2. Learning about other people's research and exchanging ideas
3. Networking with potential employers and hearing about job opportunities
4. Reconnecting with former colleagues 
5. Being able to list the poster presentation on your vitae
6. Gauging general interest and possibly getting some intel about potential reviewers 

<b>Design:</b> 

1. Make your poster as easy to read as possible by minimizing the amount of text (and including structured white space)
2. Consider highlighting which part of a figure the viewer should be focusing on (like indicating the ROI with a red circle)
3. Use titles to describe specific results (an example would be to write "x increases y," rather than "effects of x on y")
4. Include the poster number and/or section number at the top to make it easier for people to find

<b>Submission:</b>

1. If you submit a poster to a conference, make sure you can attend!
2. Underpromise, but overdeliver (i.e. it's better to add than subtract findings)
3. Aim for publication (i.e. use the presentation to move your work along the publication pipeline)
4. Don't leave empty-handed (i.e., get names / emails to send the work once it's published)
