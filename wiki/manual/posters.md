<b>Goals/Motivation:</b>

Benefits of presenting a poster include

1. Publicizing your research to the scientific community and getting feedback
2. Learning about other people's research and exchanging ideas
3. Networking with potential employers and hearing about job opportunities
4. Reconnecting with former colleagues 
5. Being able to list the poster presentation on your CV
6. Gauging general interest and possibly getting some intel about possible reviewers for the future

<b>Design:</b> 

1. Make your poster as easy to read as possible by minimizing the amount of text 
2. Consider delineating which part of a figure the viewer should be focusing on (like indicating the ROI with a red circle)
3. Be specific with your results (an example would be to write "x increases y," rather than "x is related to y")
4. Include the poster number and/or section number at the top to make it easier for people to find your poster during the poster session

<b>Submission:</b>

1. If you submit a poster to a conference, make sure you can actually be there and present it
2. Underpromise, overdeliver (i.e. your findings)
3. Aim for publication
