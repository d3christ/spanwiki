Goals/Motivation:

Design: 

1. Make your poster as easy to read as possible by minimizing the amount of text
2. Consider indicating what part of a figure the viewer should be focusing on (like marking an ROI with a red circle)
3. Include the poster number and/or session number at the top to make it easier for people to find it during the presentation

Submission:

If you submit a poster, make sure you will be around to present it!

Underpromise, overdeliver

Aim for publication
