From the creators of aspredicted.org:

"Preregistrations are time-stamped documents in which researchers specify exactly how they plan to collect their data and to conduct their key confirmatory analyses. The goal of a preregistration is to make it easy to distinguish between planned, confirmatory analyses – those for which statistical significance is meaningful – and unplanned exploratory analyses – those for which statistical significance is not meaningful. Because a good preregistration prevents researchers from p-hacking, it also protects them from suspicions of p-hacking."
