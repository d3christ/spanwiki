<b>Setting up preregistration</b>: 

A new website that helps you preregister your study: https://aspredicted.org/

Instructions for preregistering on the Open Science Framework (OSF): http://help.osf.io/m/registrations/l/524205-register-your-project

From the creators of aspredicted.org:

"Preregistrations are time-stamped documents in which researchers specify exactly how they plan to collect their data and to conduct their key confirmatory analyses. The goal of a preregistration is to make it easy to distinguish between planned, confirmatory analyses – those for which statistical significance is meaningful – and unplanned exploratory analyses – those for which statistical significance is not meaningful. Because a good preregistration prevents researchers from p-hacking, it also protects them from suspicions of p-hacking."

Additional note:

Following completion of your study, you can consider uploading your data and scripts to the OSF data repository.  If it's a neuroimaging study, consider uploading to Neurovault, a public repository for brain maps, parcellations, and atlases: https://neurovault.org/

Avoid uploading raw brain data, as it unnecessary, very bulky, and could even be identifiable/traced back to the subject based on anatomy.
