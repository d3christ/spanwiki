<b>Setting up preregistration</b>: 

A new website that helps you preregister your study: https://aspredicted.org/

Instructions for preregistering on Open Science Framework (OSF): http://help.osf.io/m/registrations/l/524205-register-your-project

An example of a study we have preregistered: https://osf.io/d3fkp/

<b>Definition (from aspredicted.org):</b>

"Preregistrations are time-stamped documents in which researchers specify exactly how they plan to collect their data and to conduct their key confirmatory analyses. The goal of a preregistration is to make it easy to distinguish between planned, confirmatory analyses – those for which statistical significance is meaningful – and unplanned exploratory analyses – those for which statistical significance is not meaningful. Because a good preregistration prevents researchers from p-hacking, it also protects them from suspicions of p-hacking."

Note that preregistered hypotheseses could be general or specific, and that it's okay not to predict everything (e.g., you could predict that confounds won't interfere, or that you'll test between different theories) 

<b>Additional notes:</b>

1. After completing your study, consider uploading your data and scripts to the OSF data repository (see above link).  For FMRI studies, you can also upload your maps to Neurovault (a public repository for brain maps, parcellations, and atlases: https://neurovault.org/).  First, convert your maps into nifti files and then you can publish your collection as either public or private (typically it is best to wait until manuscript publication before making your collection public).  Here is an example: https://neurovault.org/collections/FNVNSLEC/

2. As an added benefit, archiving your data also stores it and makes it easily available for later use!

3. There is an open question about which data to upload (e.g., raw versus processed). We prefer processed (currently), since it reserves other data for different analyses / writeups / etc, preserves subject anonymity, and minimizes errors for those who seek to reproduce the analyses.
