<b>Reviewing</b> (each ~ 1-2 paragraphs, except Comments): 

1. Summarize / paraphrase (restating the contribution in your own words)
2. Note major strengths (most don't, sadly)
3. Note major weaknesses (as suggestions for improvement, if possible)
4. List minor points (but not your job to rewrite)
5. Comments to editor? (optional)
